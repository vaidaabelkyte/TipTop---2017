<h3><i>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
The aim of the project was to develop an efﬁcient SprinBoot Java web application for order
ing food online with collaborative ﬁltering and search engine to simplify user experience in
decision making.

</p>

<h3><i>Technologies</h3>
<p>

- <a href="https://spring.io/"> Spring framework</a><br>
- <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html">Java programming language
</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySql database
</a><br>
- <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate for data access
</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf for presentation

<h3><i>Set of Objectives
</h3>
<p>

- Smarter food ordering system. It has to be better and stand out from the ones in the
market.<br>
-  User friendly interface for back-end user and front-end user with well designed integra
tion with each other.<br>
- Back-end application and front-end application running on two separate servers to in
crease the level of usability and lower the cost of maintenance if one part of the system
would fail.<br>
-  Easy to use and up to date registration system.<br>
- Easy to use and well designed collaborative ﬁltering system and search method:<br>
  – Filter the menu depending on customer food intolerance like gluten, soya, milk,
eggs and ect.<br>
  – Filter the menu by the desired amount of calories.<br>
  – Search by food types and categories<br>
  – Spring Data Elasticsearch in the header section to make everything even more sim
pler. User can start the search right from the home page.<br>
  – Search by keyword - applying fuzzy search method in the menu page.<br>
  
-  Recommendation engine based on user experience.<br>
- An option to create personal account and save payment details and delivery addresses.<br>
- Efﬁcient database management system for back-end application.
<br>

<h3><i>Instructions to run the application

</h3>
<p>

In order to use and connect to database, need to create schema before running the application.<br>
This step can be done by running a command in Wamp server MySql console window:<br>
<strong>CREATE DATABASE tiptopdatabase;</strong><br>
<br>
Or if there is a workbench installed, just by creating a new schema with name  <strong>”tiptop
database”.</strong>
<br><br>
Note that data source name and password in the application properties might need to be
changed to your database connection credentials.<br>
<br>
<strong>Additional info:</strong><br>

For registering new user or using email password recovery function, antivirus software
might need to be stopped on that machine.<br>
Both applications front-end and back-end, need to run as Spring boot app.<br>
Front-end application can be accessed: <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong><br>
Back-end application can be accessed:<strong> http://localhost:8081/backEnd/login</strong><br>
Log-in for administration app is:<br>
Username: <strong>admin</strong><br>
Password:<strong> admin</strong><br>
If the registering for new user would fail, can use default value for log-in:<br>
Username:<strong> spring</strong><br>
Password:<strong> boot</strong>

<h3><i>Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Focusing on my project, the main objective of the project was to develop user friendly web
application for ordering food online with collaborative ﬁltering and easy to use search engine.
Application type was stated as a prototype which could be used in building a complete system
for a speciﬁc business. Spring Boot met all the requirements I had described in the planning
phase.<br>
Main functionality is working correctly however the improvement could be done in further
development process. Filtering system could be more efﬁcient if user could select few types in
one search.<br>
For the further development of the system I will focus on user based experience integration
into system like recommendation engine.<br>
After several months of development and design, I gained valuable experience for my future
work in similar projects.<br>
